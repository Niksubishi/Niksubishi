# Hello, my name is Nik Bishop

### About me   
<p align="left">I'm passionate about blending creativity with technology, and coding has become my way of turning ideas into reality. With a background in graphic design, I’ve always had a strong visual sense, and my love for design started early, when I spent hours experimenting with Photoshop as a kid. Over time, this creative passion evolved, leading me toward the world of web development.
<br>
My journey into coding started as an exploration of the balance between creativity and logic. While I've always enjoyed working with design, the problem-solving aspects of development really spoke to me. Today, as a student at Noroff University, I’m focused on enhancing my skills in front-end development and UX/UI design, aiming to create user-centered experiences that are both beautiful and functional.
<br>
What excites me most is the process—the thrill of watching a project grow from an idea into a polished, finished product. Each step along the way brings a new challenge and an opportunity to think creatively, and that’s what keeps me motivated.
<br>
Outside of my coding journey, I continue to nurture my creative side through music and other design projects. Whether I’m creating digital art or just relaxing with a good movie, I find that these activities help fuel my passion for creating.
